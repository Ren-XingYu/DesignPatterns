# Intent

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

# Motivation

Sometimes it's necessary to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the request.

# 本质：封装请求
