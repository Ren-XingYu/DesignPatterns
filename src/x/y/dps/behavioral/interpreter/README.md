# Intent

Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

# Motivation

If a particular kind of problem occurs often enough, then it might be worthwhile to express instances of the problem as sentences in a simple language. Then you can build an interpreter that solves the problem by interpreting these sentences.
