# Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 

# Motivation

A reader for the RTF (Rich Text Format) document exchange format should be able to convert RTF to many text formats. The reader might convert RTF documents into plain ASCII text or into a text widget that can be edited interactively.

# 本质：分离整体构建算法和部件构造
