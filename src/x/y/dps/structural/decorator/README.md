# Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 

# Motivation 

Sometimes we want to add responsibilities to individual objects, not to an entire class. A graphical user interface toolkit, for example, should let you add properties like borders or behaviors like scrolling to any user interface component. 

# 本质：动态组合

# Java中的IO流使用的是装饰模式

# 装饰模式和AOP思想上有共同之处，AOP用动态代理来实现
